    <p>
        Autocompleting text with known values seems like an easy problem to solve, but
        so so so many UIs get it wrong. I see this frequently enough that, rather than
        complain them individually, I though, I&apos;d just write down the set of rules they
        offen break.
    </p>
    <p>
        There may be cases where some of these rules aren&apos;t the best thing to do, but there
        should be a good reason for breaking one of these rules (for example, some of
        these rules don&apos;t apply if a field must be filled with a values from a fixed set, like
        the list of US states). Following these rules should always result in at very least a
        sane experience:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Exact matches always come first. If the user types in an option exactly,
            other options must always go below the one matching what they typed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Besides exact matches, prefix matches come first. If I type &ldquo;Fr&rdquo; I want
            &ldquo;Fresno&rdquo; not &ldquo;San Fransisco&rdquo;.
        </li>
        <li>
            After prefix matches, it can fall back to substring matches. Starting to substring 
            matches would almost allways be the wrong thing to do since users start typing words
            at the beginning not somwhere in the middle.
        </li>
        <li>
            If there are no substring matches, it can optionally fall back to subsequence matching. 
            This is only useful in some cases.
        </li>
        <li>
            If there are no subsequence/substring matches, it can optionally fall back to
            approximate matches. This is rarely necessary to provide.
        </li>
        <li>
            Matches should be sorted alphabetically.
        </li>
        <li>
            When one option is the prefix of another, put the <em>shortest one first</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
            The matching should probably be case insensitive unless there are two options that
            differ only by case. In that case (pun intended), prefer the one that more closely
            matches the user&apos;s input.
        </li>
        <li>
            The action to make use of the selection (e.g. to search the term) must be a different key
            than the action to accept the first suggestion <em>unless</em> you have to do something first
            to start using autocomplete suggestions (e.g. hit the down arrow). The user should never have
            to take extra steps to <em>not</em> use autocomplete.
        </li>
    </ul>
